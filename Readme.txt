Synopsis: 

This is the creation of a new brand by combinig two actual brands: Gehwol that is a foot care brand and Holsten that is a beer brand, The re-branding I will use for this project is take the information of Gehwol and put it in the Style and Design of Holsten, thus the new brand will be a beer brand as well. This is a project made for Fanshawe College for the program of Interactive Media Design Level 2.

Development Js:

The first step will be to determine the functions my web page will have, thinking about the user experience and interactivity, knowing that a phone version is needed, a hamburger menu for a good and comfortable use of the page in that size will be needed, second: It is required to use an array for the delivery of a banner animation that will show the different products that Gehwol (New brand) offers and its respective prices and names and Finally I will add another banner to show the different advertisements I have created for the promotion of Gehwol.
